# Java-Quiz
Coding Quiz! 

I started this project with my HTML then gradually adding my CSS, Then finally my Javascript. While it is not complete, I was able to log to the console when clicking the start button. I tried to start from scratch but I didnt have the time. So this is what im working with for now. 

Still working on my buttons and timer through JavaScipt, HTML and CSS.
